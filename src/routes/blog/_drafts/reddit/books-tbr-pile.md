title: My system for managing a TBR pile that completely got away from me

At its worst, my TBR situation looked like this: 47 books on my nightstand and surrounding floor area, 312 books on my Kindle, 8 library holds arriving at unpredictable intervals, and a running list of BookTok recommendations in my Notes app that I would add to but never consult. I was somehow always "looking for something to read" while drowning in unread books.

The guilt was the worst part. Every book I had not started felt like a small broken promise. I would buy a new one, feel excited for a day, then feel bad about all the ones I bought before it. Reading — the thing I do to relax — had become a source of low-grade anxiety.

Here is what actually helped me get a grip on it.

First, I separated "interested" from "committed." This was the single biggest change. I made two distinct categories: a Wishlist for books I had heard about and thought sounded good, and an actual TBR for books I owned or had checked out and was genuinely planning to read in the near future. My Wishlist is enormous and I do not care. My active TBR is around 10-15 books at any given time.

Second, I limited "currently reading" to two books maximum. One fiction, one nonfiction. That is it. Before this rule I would have six books going at once and make progress on none of them.

Third, the "would I start this today?" audit. Every month or so I look at my TBR and ask that question about each book. If the honest answer is no, it goes back to the Wishlist. No guilt. My tastes shift. A book that excited me in March might not excite me in October, and that is fine. It is not going anywhere.

Fourth, I stopped fighting mood reading. I used to try to read my TBR in order — oldest first, or alternating by genre in some elaborate rotation. That turned reading into a chore. Now I just look at my short TBR list and pick what I actually want to read right now.

Fifth, I alternate long and short books. After a 600-page novel, I read something I can finish in a day or two. Keeps the momentum going and stops that feeling of being stuck on one book for weeks.

Here is what did NOT work for me: buying freezes. Every time I tried a "no new books" rule, reading started to feel like punishment — like I was eating leftovers until they were gone. I buy less now, but because the system naturally curbs impulse purchases, not because of a restriction.

Rigid reading schedules did not work either. "30 pages a day" sounds great until you are forcing yourself through something you are not in the mood for just to hit a number.

I built a tool called BacklogBox (backlogbox.com) that gives me Kanban columns for my TBR — and also tracks my movies, games, and other media — but a spreadsheet or even sticky notes on your bookshelf work too. The method matters more than the app.
