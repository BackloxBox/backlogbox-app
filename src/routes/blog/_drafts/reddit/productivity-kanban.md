title: I applied personal Kanban to my entertainment backlog and it was weirdly life-changing

I have been using Kanban for work projects for years. Columns, WIP limits, weekly reviews — the whole thing. One day I realized my Netflix watchlist, Steam library, and TBR pile were causing the same decision paralysis as an unmanaged work backlog. Hundreds of items, no prioritization, no visibility into what I was actually in the middle of. Just an ever-growing pile of "I should get to that."

So I tried applying the same framework. It felt a little silly at first — putting Kanban discipline on watching TV shows — but the results genuinely surprised me.

The setup is dead simple. Four columns: Wishlist (stuff I have heard about and might want to consume someday), Backlog (things I have committed to — I own the book, I have the game, the show is on a service I pay for), In Progress (what I am actively watching, reading, or playing), and Completed.

The critical rule, same as work Kanban: a WIP limit on In Progress. I keep it at two or three items per media type. If I want to start a new show, I have to finish or drop one first. No more having eight shows "in progress" that I last watched three months ago.

Once a week — usually Sunday — I do a five-minute review. Anything in Backlog that I am no longer excited about moves back to Wishlist. Anything in In Progress that I have not touched in two weeks gets an honest evaluation: am I going to come back to this, or am I just avoiding the decision to drop it?

Here is why it works, and I think it is the same reason it works for knowledge work.

It reduces decision fatigue. When I sit down to watch something, I am choosing from three options instead of scrolling through a watchlist of 200. The decision was already made during my weekly review when I was in a more deliberate headspace.

It makes progress visible. There is something genuinely satisfying about dragging a card to the Completed column. It sounds trivial, but seeing a growing list of things I have actually finished is more motivating than I expected. Without it, finished media just disappears from your life with no record.

It prevents guilt accumulation. A Wishlist of 500 items feels fine because it is explicitly "maybe someday." A Backlog of 15 intentionally chosen items feels manageable. The old model — one giant undifferentiated list — made everything feel overdue.

The unexpected benefits caught me off guard. I actually finish things now. I went from completing maybe two or three TV series a year (while "watching" ten) to finishing eight or nine. I spend less money on impulse purchases because adding something to a Wishlist scratches the same itch as buying it — it is captured, I will not forget it. And I enjoy what I consume more because I chose it intentionally rather than defaulting to whatever autoplay served up.

I ended up building a tool for this — BacklogBox at backlogbox.com, which gives you Kanban boards for books, movies, TV shows, games, and podcasts — but you could do this with Trello, Notion, or even a whiteboard. The framework is what matters.
