title: How I actually started finishing games instead of just buying more

I have about 280 games on Steam. I have finished maybe 40 of them. For years, every sale was the same cycle: buy three games at 75% off, feel good about the "deals," then go back to playing the same two games I have been rotating for months.

The breaking point was when I bought a game on sale and realized I had already bought it on a different platform two years earlier and never installed it.

What actually changed things for me was treating my game library like a project board instead of a pile. Here is the system that worked, and it is embarrassingly simple.

I set up four columns: Wishlist (stuff I am interested in but not committed to), Backlog (games I own and genuinely intend to play), In Progress (what I am actively playing), and Completed. That is it. Nothing fancy.

The rule that made the biggest difference: In Progress can only have two or three games at a time. One longer RPG or story game, one shorter or pick-up-and-play game. If I want to start something new, something else has to move — either to Completed or back to Backlog if I am honest with myself that I am not feeling it.

A few other things that helped:

The one year rule. If a game has been sitting in Backlog for over a year and I have not started it, I move it back to Wishlist. I might still play it someday, but it is not taking up mental space as something I "should" be doing.

Redefining "completed." Rolling credits is completed. I do not need to 100% anything. If I played a multiplayer game for 50 hours and I am done with it, that is completed. Removing the pressure to fully exhaust a game before moving on was huge.

Playing what excites me right now instead of what "should" come next. I used to try to go in order — oldest purchase first, or "most acclaimed" first. That made gaming feel like homework. Now I just look at my Backlog column and pick whatever I am actually in the mood for.

Alternating long and short games. After finishing a 60-hour RPG, I pick something I can finish in a weekend. Keeps the momentum going and the Completed column growing, which is oddly motivating.

The result is not dramatic — I am not suddenly clearing 10 games a month. But I went from finishing maybe 5 games a year to around 15-20, and more importantly I actually enjoy sitting down to play because I am not staring at a list of 280 options wondering where to start.

I use a tool called BacklogBox (backlogbox.com) for this, but honestly any Kanban board or even a spreadsheet works. The system matters more than the tool.
