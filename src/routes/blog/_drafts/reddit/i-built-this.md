title: I built an all-in-one media tracker because I was tired of using Goodreads, Letterboxd, and Backloggd separately

At some point last year I realized I was maintaining accounts on five different apps just to track the stuff I consume. Goodreads for books. Letterboxd for movies. Backloggd for games. A Notes app list for TV shows. A mental list for podcasts that I would immediately forget.

So I built BacklogBox.

The core idea is Kanban boards for all your media. Books, movies, TV series, games, podcasts — each gets its own board with columns you can customize. Drag something from Wishlist to In Progress when you start it. Drag it to Completed when you finish. Simple as that.

I should be honest about what it is NOT. It is not a social network. There is no community review system like Letterboxd has. There is no auto-scrobbling like Trakt. It does not replace the depth of any single-media tracker — it replaces the breadth problem of needing five of them.

Built with SvelteKit, which has been a joy to work with for this kind of interactive, drag-heavy UI.

It is at backlogbox.com — there is a 14-day free trial, no credit card required, so you can see if it fits your workflow before committing.

I would genuinely love feedback, especially on what feels missing or clunky. I have been heads-down building this for a while and fresh eyes always catch things I have gone blind to.
